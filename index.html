    <h2>Types of Various guitars</h2>
   

    <ol style="list-style:url(image/cross2.png);font-size:18px">
        <!--List for Types of Phobia-->
        <li><strong>classical guitar:</strong> The classical guitar, also known as the Spanish guitar, was originally made to play classical or flamenco music but they are now used to play whichever type of music the player desires.</li>
        <li><strong>acoustic guitar:</strong> The acoustic guitar is similar to the classical guitar but instead of nylon strings it is typically made with steel strings that produce a much louder sound. </li>
        <li><strong>electro-acoustic guitar:</strong>The electro-acoustic guitar is basically the same as an acoustic guitar but with the option to amplify the sound by plugging into amplifiers.</li>
        <li><strong>electric guitar:</strong>Electric guitars differ from other types of guitar because they produce a sound by converting the vibration of the strings into electric signals.</li>
        <li><strong>bass guitar:</strong> The bass guitar is designed to produce a much lower tone than the other guitars. Most modern bass guitars are electric and feature four strings, though some bass guitars do have five or six stings. </li>

    <h2>WHat is an Acoustic Guitar??</h2>
    

    <p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 18px"><strong style="color:whitesmoke">
        An acoustic guitar is a musical instrument in the guitar family. Its strings vibrate a sound board on a resonant body to project a sound wave through the air. The original, general term for this stringed instrument is guitar, and the retronym 'acoustic guitar' distinguishes it from an electric guitar, which relies on electronic amplification. Typically, a guitar's body is a sound box, of which the top side serves as a sound board that enhances the vibration sounds of the strings. In standard tuning the guitar's six strings are tuned (low to high) E2 A2 D3 G3 B3 E4.

Guitar strings may be plucked individually with a pick (plectrum) or fingertip, or strummed to play chords. Plucking a string causes it to vibrate at a fundamental pitch determined by the string's length, mass, and tension. (Overtones are also present, closely related to harmonics of the fundamental pitch.) The string causes the soundboard and the air enclosed by the sound box to vibrate. As these have their own resonances, they amplify some overtones more strongly than others, affecting the timbre of the resulting sound

    <h2>DO's And Dont's While  Learning  a  Guitar</h2>
   

    <p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 18px">
        #1 – Don’t Ignore the Basics.It takes time to master an instrument, and there are few things more important than setting a solid foundation for yourself.Beginners tend to do one of two things wrong: Either they get too distracted, or they simply don’t practice enough.
For instance, if you sat down to practice for 40 minutes, but you don’t focus on the material you need to work on for 20 minutes, you only practiced for 20 minutes.And, if you don’t work on the material your teacher assigned you, you’re not practicing the right things.
The first step is to work on the rudiments. Then you can begin exploring other aspects of the instrument.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 18px">#2 – Don’t Just Learn Bits and Pieces of a Song
What’s the most exciting part about playing guitar? Generally, it’s the riffs and solos. But when you’re learning a new song, you shouldn’t just skip to the best parts and learn those.
Imagine how frustrating it would be to find yourself among other musicians at a jam session and not be able to play a whole song through because you’ve only studied bits and pieces of 50 different songs.
Think of what your friends will say when they ask you to play something for them, and you have to stop every 20 seconds because you don’t know the rest. You can probably imagine their disappointed faces already.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 18px">#3 – Do Improvise
Take inspiration from other players. Try learning their parts. Then, reinvent them or put your own spin on them.
Study the greats. Observe how they play and learn their licks, riffs, and solos.
But don’t settle there. Once you’ve become familiar with their works, try playing with the structure. Change up the notes. Play with the tempo, phrasing, or key signature. Try playing the piece backwards.
<p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 18px">#4 – Do Meet and Learn from Many Musicians & Sources
You can learn something from every musician. Don’t limit your progress by only utilizing one source.
First, go to guitar forums, find the answers to your beginner dilemmas, make friends that share your musical interests, and discover interesting websites recommended by other members. Forums and social media are excellent for exchanging ideas and asking questions.
Second, find a partner to practice with. Improvise with him/her and talk about your setups, guitar accessories and the technical issues you’ve come across. Learning together is way more fun and effective than learning alone.</p>
